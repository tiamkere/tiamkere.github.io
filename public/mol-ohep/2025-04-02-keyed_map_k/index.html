Rushing waist-high wastewater flows south towards an intersection. The brick walls are green with algae and the air is warm with stink.

Rushing water: The noise of the water flow and echo of the PC&rsquo;s movement drowns out most other noises.
Sewage: The wastewater is non-potable. Because it is sewage.

Physical Save: A creature that drinks the water or enters it with open wounds must succeed on a Physical save or contract Brown Rot (ELEPHANT: link!)

<blockquote>
<p>Rushing waist-high wastewater flows south towards an intersection. The brick walls are green with algae and the air is warm with stink.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Rushing water:</strong> The noise of the water flow and echo of the PC&rsquo;s movement drowns out most other noises.</p>
<p><strong>Sewage:</strong> The wastewater is non-potable. Because it is sewage.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Physical Save:</em> A creature that drinks the water or enters it with open wounds must succeed on a Physical save or contract Brown Rot (ELEPHANT: link!)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Exits:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>S to <a href="#K2">K2</a>, ledge along west wall.</li>
<li>N off the map, may land the PCs on the first floor of <a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/407420/under-the-city">Under the City</a>.</li>
<li>1a to the cellar of <em>Ms. Bea</em>&rsquo;s, brothel. Cellar is a changing/bathing/costume room. 1b blocked.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="K2">K2. Small Sewer Intersection</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Streams from the north and east intersect in a whirl of water and noise. The flagstones of the ledge are slippery, and the iron rings attached to the northern wall are cold with damp.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Also on the ledge:</strong> Coil of rope, unlit lantern (no oil), one very dirty boot (other on the bottom of the sewer).</p>
<p><strong>Rings and ropes</strong>: The iron rings set in the wall are occasionally used by the <code>Silt Boys</code> and the <code>Assassins</code> to dock small canoes here.</p>
<p><strong>Western door</strong>:  Damp wood, creaky, not locked.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>OI</em>: small symbol of the <code>Assassins</code> etched into the handle.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Exits</strong> :</p>
<ul>
<li>N to <a href="#K1">K1</a></li>
<li>E to <a href="#K3">K3</a>, wooden door.</li>
<li>S to <a href="#K31">K31</a>, downstream. No ledges.</li>
<li>W to <a href="#K6">K6</a>, upstream. Glinting of a grate ahead in any light.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="K3">K3. Decoy Storage Room</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>A damp, low-ceilinged cellar. The floor is covered in mouldy straw and rat shit. Nibbled boxes are stacked against the northern wall; the crumbling brickwork of the southern wall is on display.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Boxes</strong>: wooden. Contain a few ropes, sheets of canvas, nails, etc. 4 in 6 chance of disturbing a <strong>nest of rats</strong> (foul but harmless) whenever opening one. The rats go fleeing out any open door.</p>
<p><strong>Southern wall:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>OI</em>: Some of the bricks aren&rsquo;t mortared together. The missing mortar outlines a door. Pressing on this area of the wall opens a trapped secret door to #K4.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Secret door:</strong> Section of brickwork swings away in the southern wall. Not locked, but trapped.</p>
<ul>
<li>Trap: 5 in 6 chance of being active.</li>
<li>Active:</li>
<li>Inactive: An <code>Assassin</code> passed through recently, and deactivated it from the other side. They&rsquo;ll be back in 4 turns.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Exits</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>W to <a href="#K2">K2</a>, wooden door.</li>
<li>S to <a href="#K4">K4</a>, secret door.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="K4">K4. Hallway</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>A dry, pale, low-ceilinged hallway. At its eastern end, a faded mosaic of a figure in robes graces an alcove. Their face has been scratched off.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Stone</strong>: pale flagstones, unlike the sewer&rsquo;s brickwork.</p>
<p><strong>Mosaic</strong>: Floor-to-ceiling in the alcove, made with tiny painted ceramic tiles. The colours are faded, but some detail is still recognisable. The figure is holding a book in one hand, and an orb in the other.</p>
<ul>
<li>If removed from the wall without harm (very difficult), worth 200sp to the right collector.</li>
<li><em>Pray or Know 8</em>: The robes of the figure in the mosaic are like those worn at the <strong>Abbey at Starraxven</strong>, a school for mages about a week&rsquo;s ride north of Mol Ohep.</li>
<li><em>Know 14</em>: The mosaic shows <strong>Nokla Deirdram</strong> an obscure headmaster of the Abbey who lived about 1000 years ago.</li>
<li><em>GM info</em>: Nokla Deirdram was one of the lead arcanists in the casting of the spell that transmuted a battlefield full of mud into the first goblins. All mages involved died in the casting, so the workings of the spell that did this are unclear to modern mages. Deirdram&rsquo;s surviving notebook is held, in utmost secrecy, at the Abbey.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Exits</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>W to MAP M</li>
<li>S to <a href="#K5">K5</a>. Wooden door, unlocked.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="K5">K5. Former Vesper</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>A lonely room with a creaking bench set against the eastern wall.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Exits</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>N to <a href="#K4">K4</a>. Wooden door, unlocked.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="K6">K6. The Vaulted Chamber</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The sewer carves a channel through the centre of a many-vaulted chamber, passing under a remaining bit of floor as if under a bridge. Over the sewer canal, the vaults drip down into points where pillars were removed to make way for the water. Occasionally, the darkness is broken by wretched spluttering.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>2d4 Wringwingers</strong>: Hiding in the ceiling. Terrible little creatures: slime-skinned and bulb-eyed, with an almost piscine face, wings, and fingers that are far too long.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Reaction check</em>: If positive, the imps call out in Common for alms. If negative, hide in the ceiling until they can ambush a single PC for dinner.</li>
<li>Want: rid of the ghouls in <a href="#K10">K10</a>. Fresh fish. Dirtier sewer water. To see what is behind the southern door to <a href="#K16">K16</a>.</li>
<li>Loot: Small bones, buttons, a nice fishing hook, piece of amber (10sp) (across all imps).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Pillars</strong>: A row of pillars on either side of the sewer supports the ceiling. Knocking down more than half the pillars collapses that side of the room.</p>
<p><strong>Bridge</strong>: Bit of floor left in place during construction of the sewer.</p>
<ul>
<li>Very low. Characters need to lie flat in any boat or duck mostly underwater to pass underneath.</li>
</ul>
