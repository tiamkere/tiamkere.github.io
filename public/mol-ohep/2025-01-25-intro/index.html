    <h1>My Private Jakalla/Mol Ohep Jakalla</h1>

    

    <p>Sandboxing is fun! It means that I can prep scenarios to my heart&rsquo;s content and let my players loose in them, without worrying about things like &ldquo;narrative structure&rdquo; or &ldquo;plot&rdquo; or &ldquo;game balance&rdquo;. Since I love nothing more than making up webs of intrigue, and nothing less than figuring out how many HD of skeletons is a reasonable amount, sandbox campaigns are a platonic ideal.</p>
<p>So the new year&rsquo;s new campaign is a sandbox campaign set in <code>Mol Ohep</code>, a big capitol on the Mollian coast. Mol Ohep is your standard intriguing capitol: densely populated, ages old,  built on former ruins of itself. Sea to the west, plains to the north, mountains to the east; PC&rsquo;s in the middle of it all trying to take advantage of the upcoming mayoral election.</p>
<p>(pic of MO here)</p>
<p>We play WWN, so I told my players to read up on the faction rules and to make up a faction for their characters to all be a part of. They came back a week later with characters who were all part of the noble house that built the city&rsquo;s sewer system, and that their goal was nothing less than the full restoration of said sewer system.</p>
<p>Cool! Good, concrete goal that ties into the setting and has multiple pathways of interacting with the running clock of the impeding election!</p>
<p>Sewers, though?</p>
<p>So on the hunt for sewer-related material I went. It did not take me long to stumble on <a href="https://dysonlogos.blog/maps/my-private-jakalla/">Dyson&rsquo;s My Private Jakalla</a>, an incredible under-city map including sewers. The only problem? It is unkeyed, and drawn for the titular city, Jakalla, in the Empire of the Petal Throne setting. The setting is <a href="https://www.rpg.net/reviews/archive/18/18663.phtml">apparently brilliant</a>, it&rsquo;s author <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M._A._R._Barker#Neo-Nazi/white_supremacist_work">not so much</a>. Regardless of either of these factors, my city is Mol Ohep, which <em>definitely wasn&rsquo;t</em> drawn by copying a map of late 16th century Amsterdam. It wouldn&rsquo;t be translatable to Jakalla even if I wanted it to be.</p>

    alt="alt-test"><figcaption>

<p>The map, therefore, needs two things to be used:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adaptation to the setting</li>
<li>Keying</li>
<li>Oh also stocking, which I just realised isn&rsquo;t technically a part of keying</li>
</ul>
<p>The first needs to happen before the second, I think. It seems difficult to reasonably figure out who and what goes where without establishing what &ldquo;where&rdquo; means in the context of Mol Ohep. But I&rsquo;ve never stocked a map this big before. So I think what I&rsquo;m specifically going to do is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adaptation to the setting
<ul>
<li>Figure out how the Jakalla map (J) fits into my Mol Ohep map (MO)</li>
<li>Note down the location of MO landmarks on the J, to see what landmarks should have basements/ruins below them</li>
<li>Note down the locations of J exits on the MO map, to see where in the city the PCs can get to J</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Keying
<ul>
<li>Figure out whether to use the piecewise maps or the composed map. We play using FoundryVTT, so piecewise would be possible but also a pain to add walls/lights/etc to.</li>
<li>Key the map, probably using the piecewise map names (&ldquo;1A&rdquo;, &ldquo;1N&rdquo;, etc) as a basis</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Stocking
<ul>
<li>Uhhh faction influence is probably a good place to start - figure out what areas are controlled by established factors</li>
<li>Consider tertiary dungeons - I&rsquo;m using the lovely <a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/407420/under-the-city">Under the City</a> as a starting point to ease the group in. It&rsquo;s got sewers in it, so these should connect somewhere</li>
<li>Random Tables Go!</li>
<li>Oh yeah, most importantly: this thing is massive and my players might only explore 5% of it. So I should start at the places they&rsquo;re likely to see (the connection to UTC, as they might chase after a gang of ruffians who broke into a warehouse).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Yeah, so that&rsquo;s the goal of this blog: to track my progress in this whole endeavour, in the hope that it will teach me something about dungeons and perhaps be helpful to anyone else wanting to use the map.</p>
