    <h1>Analysis of the Jakalla Map II</h1>

    

    <p>This is part 3 of my mucking about with DysonLogo&rsquo;s <a href="https://dysonlogos.blog/maps/my-private-jakalla/">My Private Jakalla</a> map. I&rsquo;ve figured out how I want to position the map beneath my city, Mol Ohep. Next, I want to try and figure out what rooms are in what piecewise maps and where the big factions are.</p>
<p>So I went ahead and divided the map into its piecewise components. We can see that they are not square and not in a grid (shout-out especially to 1L). Making this composite map must&rsquo;ve been a bunch of work!</p>

<h3 id="factions-where-are-they">Factions: Where are they?</h3>
<p>Next, I want to figure out where the factions are. The map is aligned by putting the western temple beneath the <code>university</code>&rsquo;s peninsula, so that belongs to them (light green). Likewise, the pyramid is below the <code>city hall</code>, so we&rsquo;re giving that over to the city administration (bright pink).</p>
<p>I know my two crime factions should have headquarters in the sewers. The <code>Silt Boys</code> are most active near the Old Docks, on the western side of the city, so I&rsquo;ll put their hideout (gray-green) roughly between the Old Docks and the central city. The <code>Carmines</code> I didn&rsquo;t have pinned down by location yet, so I&rsquo;ll give them the complex with the ritual room in the south (bright red).</p>
<p>Hmmm. Who else? Well, there are <code>goblins</code> living in the city, so let&rsquo;s give them the crypt place in the northwest of the city (brown) - it&rsquo;s got a good connection to the aboveground but isn&rsquo;t too connected to the rest of the sewers, so it makes a defensible home.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a high-rolling <code>gambling ring</code> of nobility, wealthy folks, and other influencia that needs a secret meeting spot. I&rsquo;ll give them that cool room in the southeast-ish (gold), and define the access paths needing to get there as their territory as well (they can hire guards or something to hold watch). Let&rsquo;s also put a contrasting <code>basement gambling</code> ring of miscellaneous lower-class people in one of the safer sections with good surface connections (orange).</p>
<p>Uhhhh what else? Cults! There&rsquo;s a really tangled bit of temple complex in the 1A map. I&rsquo;ll give the upper part of it (bright purple) to the <code>worshippers of Zedras</code>, the god of of writing and stories. Also, while I was mulling over this the words <code>shrimp cult</code> came to me, so let&rsquo;s give them the flooded section in the southwest (shrimp pink). I don&rsquo;t know what the shrimp cult is, yet (do they worship shrimp? are they shrimp that worship something? shrimp dragon?), but we&rsquo;ll find out.</p>
<p>A city intrigue game needs <code>assassins</code>. Let&rsquo;s banish them to the northwestern complex (dark gray). According to my overlap map this puts the entrances to their section squarely in the bay, underneath a section of water that might soon be raised for new building. But since I don&rsquo;t plan to be 100% faithful to this overlay anyways, we&rsquo;ll say those instead emerge on the little western island next to Central.</p>
<p>Next, my players are almost certainly going to be entering this map from the north, via its connection to Under the City. I want them to be able to interact with sewer denizens very quickly after entering, so we&rsquo;ll put the <code>auction house</code> in the weird temple structure in the north (blue-purple) - a meeting place for the weird and shady merchants and their weird and shady goods.</p>
<p>Lastly, the <code>water</code>. J includes some submerged sections, one of which is where the shrimp cult now happily resides. Since part of the structures are off the MO map anyways, and since I want to give the illusion of the sewers being pretty deep beneath the city (because they need to be above water level but how does this work in a pretty flat city???), I&rsquo;m going to make some of the deepest western sections fully submerged (dark blue). Just, flat out full of water. Where this doesn&rsquo;t make sense due to stairs, we&rsquo;ll just say that the ground slopes downwards enough for the physics to work out.</p>
<p>Ok! Those are the factions. Cool. I should note that I have a bunch of other factions worked out for the overground of Mol Ohep that probably wouldn&rsquo;t have a significant home base in the sewers - for example, the<code>logging guild</code> and the <code>city guard</code>. Actors from those factions could appear in the sewers and have connections to their denizens, but they&rsquo;re deeply unlikely to be there full-time.</p>

<h3 id="keying-the-first-few-areas">Keying the First Few Areas</h3>
<p>Now, onto the keying. My players have started their exploration of MO&rsquo;s sewers by poking around in Under the City, which connects via level 2 to the northern sewer influx of J in 1K. So I&rsquo;m going to start with 1K and the areas around it. Because I don&rsquo;t plan for there to ever be a level 2 to this sewer complex (except where I attach other dungeons that go deeper), I&rsquo;m going to drop the &ldquo;1&rdquo; in front of all the map names and just call them A, B, K, etc.</p>
<p>Here I come to a conundrum: there is a lot of advice out there on how to <em>stock</em> dungeons, and how to write down the stocking information so it&rsquo;s comprehensible for the GM. The Alexandrian&rsquo;s <a href="https://thealexandrian.net/wordpress/35180/roleplaying-games/the-art-of-the-key">short series on keying</a> lists a fun history and a good overview of modern best practices (and it&rsquo;s easy to take inspiration from <a href="https://tenfootpole.org/ironspike/?p=5909">notoriously well-formatted adventures</a>, like OSE&rsquo;s Winter&rsquo;s Daughter). But like, where do the numbers go?</p>
<p>As in, what is the best practice for what rooms get what numbers? I spent some time looking, and there doesn&rsquo;t seem to be a consensus. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/osr/comments/1344v05/numbering_rooms/">This reddit thread</a> lists some options. I really like the idea of the page-number style from Gradient Descent, but because this dungeon is going on a blog it&rsquo;s not feasible for me. So I&rsquo;ll follow the line of thought introduced by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/osr/comments/1344v05/numbering_rooms/jid2q89/">this poster</a>, and number along likely paths. This will follow:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rooms that follow on one another have numbers that follow on one another</li>
<li>Any cluster of rooms is described by a cluster of numbers</li>
<li>Failing all else, numbers increase from left to right and from top to bottom (in natural reading order)</li>
<li><a href="https://diyanddragons.blogspot.com/2019/05/should-we-start-numbering-hallways-on.html">Hallways also get numbers</a>, or at least sub-area letters.</li>
</ul>
<p>By that second one, I mean that if there&rsquo;s a group of five rooms, and then a long hallway, and then another group of five rooms, the first group should be numbered by consecutive numbers (e.g. 4-8), and then the hallway should have a number (e.g. 9), and then the second group should be numbered with consecutive numbers (e.g. 10-14). Like so:</p>
<figure><img src="/images/Keying-example.png"
    alt="A drawing of an example room layout, copied thrice. One of the copies is blank, one is keyed sensibly, and one is keyed terribly. "><figcaption>
      <p>The middle example makes sense. The right really doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
    </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Following this reasoning, this is what I came up with for map K:</p>
<figure><img src="/images/Jakalla-K-keyed.png"
    alt="Map K keyed."><figcaption>
      <p>Map K keyed.</p>
    </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>We start at K1 with the sewer influx. Sub-areas are labelled K1a, K1b, etc. Area K2 is the little merging point in the sewers. The little secret branch leading to map M is small, so it gets numbers 3-5. Area K6 is big, encompassing the sewer leading to it and with a sub-area that leads east to map J. The bit above K6 gets numbered next. I don&rsquo;t think the cluster of half-collapsed hallways at the top of the map needs separate numbers for each 10ft, so they&rsquo;re collectively labelled K10. I think that works out fine here, but there are going to be sections in map M where what to do with the little hallway clusters will be more of a question.</p>
<p>Everything else works out in the same way going down from here.</p>
<p>Alright, and then I just repeat this process for all the maps that connect to K!</p>
<figure><img src="/images/Jakalla-north-keyed.png"
    alt="The northernmost five maps of Jakalla, all keyed."><figcaption>

    </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Of these, map M is definitely the one I&rsquo;m least confident in. The crumbling hallway portion in the center (15-21) is big enough that I don&rsquo;t think it can be one key on the map. I ended up splitting it by vertical line, giving different &ldquo;lines&rdquo; of hallways different numbers. I&rsquo;m not 100% satisfied with it, but I think it&rsquo;ll do.</p>
<p>There are also three completely disconnected rooms in this section: 4b, 14 and 17. I&rsquo;ve given them numbers because they&rsquo;re on the map, but I&rsquo;ll have to work out how the players can actually interact with these rooms.</p>
<p>Okay. In the spirit of doing useful prep, I&rsquo;m going to leave the numbering at these five maps, and begin to properly key and stock map K next!</p>
