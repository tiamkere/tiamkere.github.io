This is part 3 of my mucking about with DysonLogo's [My Private Jakalla](https://dysonlogos.blog/maps/my-private-jakalla/) map. I've figured out how I want to position the map beneath my city, Mol Ohep. Next, I want to try and figure out what rooms are in what piecewise maps and where the big factions are. 

So I went ahead and divided the map into its piecewise components. We can see that they are not square and not in a grid (shout-out especially to 1L). Making this composite map must've been a bunch of work!

### Factions: Where are they? 

Next, I want to figure out where the factions are. The map is aligned by putting the western temple beneath the `university`'s peninsula, so that belongs to them (light green). Likewise, the pyramid is below the `city hall`, so we're giving that over to the city administration (bright pink).

I know my two crime factions should have headquarters in the sewers. The `Silt Boys` are most active near the Old Docks, on the western side of the city, so I'll put their hideout (gray-green) roughly between the Old Docks and the central city. The `Carmines` I didn't have pinned down by location yet, so I'll give them the complex with the ritual room in the south (bright red). 

Hmmm. Who else? Well, there are `goblins` living in the city, so let's give them the crypt place in the northwest of the city (brown) - it's got a good connection to the aboveground but isn't too connected to the rest of the sewers, so it makes a defensible home. 

There's a high-rolling `gambling ring` of nobility, wealthy folks, and other influencia that needs a secret meeting spot. I'll give them that cool room in the southeast-ish (gold), and define the access paths needing to get there as their territory as well (they can hire guards or something to hold watch). Let's also put a contrasting `basement gambling` ring of miscellaneous lower-class people in one of the safer sections with good surface connections (orange). 

Uhhhh what else? Cults! There's a really tangled bit of temple complex in the 1A map. I'll give the upper part of it (bright purple) to the `worshippers of Zedras`, the god of of writing and stories. Also, while I was mulling over this the words `shrimp cult` came to me, so let's give them the flooded section in the southwest (shrimp pink). I don't know what the shrimp cult is, yet (do they worship shrimp? are they shrimp that worship something? shrimp dragon?), but we'll find out. 

A city intrigue game needs `assassins`. Let's banish them to the northwestern complex (dark gray). According to my overlap map this puts the entrances to their section squarely in the bay, underneath a section of water that might soon be raised for new building. But since I don't plan to be 100% faithful to this overlay anyways, we'll say those instead emerge on the little western island next to Central. 

Next, my players are almost certainly going to be entering this map from the north, via its connection to Under the City. I want them to be able to interact with sewer denizens very quickly after entering, so we'll put the `auction house` in the weird temple structure in the north (blue-purple) - a meeting place for the weird and shady merchants and their weird and shady goods. 

Lastly, the `water`. J includes some submerged sections, one of which is where the shrimp cult now happily resides. Since part of the structures are off the MO map anyways, and since I want to give the illusion of the sewers being pretty deep beneath the city (because they need to be above water level but how does this work in a pretty flat city???), I'm going to make some of the deepest western sections fully submerged (dark blue). Just, flat out full of water. Where this doesn't make sense due to stairs, we'll just say that the ground slopes downwards enough for the physics to work out. 

Ok! Those are the factions. Cool. I should note that I have a bunch of other factions worked out for the overground of Mol Ohep that probably wouldn't have a significant home base in the sewers - for example, the`logging guild` and the `city guard`. Actors from those factions could appear in the sewers and have connections to their denizens, but they're deeply unlikely to be there full-time.

### Keying the First Few Areas

Now, onto the keying. My players have started their exploration of MO's sewers by poking around in Under the City, which connects via level 2 to the northern sewer influx of J in 1K. So I'm going to start with 1K and the areas around it. Because I don't plan for there to ever be a level 2 to this sewer complex (except where I attach other dungeons that go deeper), I'm going to drop the "1" in front of all the map names and just call them A, B, K, etc. 

Here I come to a conundrum: there is a lot of advice out there on how to *stock* dungeons, and how to write down the stocking information so it's comprehensible for the GM. The Alexandrian's [short series on keying](https://thealexandrian.net/wordpress/35180/roleplaying-games/the-art-of-the-key) lists a fun history and a good overview of modern best practices (and it's easy to take inspiration from [notoriously well-formatted adventures](https://tenfootpole.org/ironspike/?p=5909), like OSE's Winter's Daughter). But like, where do the numbers go?

As in, what is the best practice for what rooms get what numbers? I spent some time looking, and there doesn't seem to be a consensus. [This reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/osr/comments/1344v05/numbering_rooms/) lists some options. I really like the idea of the page-number style from Gradient Descent, but because this dungeon is going on a blog it's not feasible for me. So I'll follow the line of thought introduced by [this poster](https://www.reddit.com/r/osr/comments/1344v05/numbering_rooms/jid2q89/), and number along likely paths. This will follow:
- Rooms that follow on one another have numbers that follow on one another
- Any cluster of rooms is described by a cluster of numbers
- Failing all else, numbers increase from left to right and from top to bottom (in natural reading order)
- [Hallways also get numbers](https://diyanddragons.blogspot.com/2019/05/should-we-start-numbering-hallways-on.html), or at least sub-area letters. 

By that second one, I mean that if there's a group of five rooms, and then a long hallway, and then another group of five rooms, the first group should be numbered by consecutive numbers (e.g. 4-8), and then the hallway should have a number (e.g. 9), and then the second group should be numbered with consecutive numbers (e.g. 10-14). Like so:

    alt="A drawing of an example room layout, copied thrice. One of the copies is blank, one is keyed sensibly, and one is keyed terribly. "
    caption="The middle example makes sense. The right really doesn't."
    >}}

Following this reasoning, this is what I came up with for map K: 

{{< figure 
    src="/images/Jakalla-K-keyed.png"
    alt="Map K keyed."
    caption="Map K keyed."
    >}}

We start at K1 with the sewer influx. Sub-areas are labelled K1a, K1b, etc. Area K2 is the little merging point in the sewers. The little secret branch leading to map M is small, so it gets numbers 3-5. Area K6 is big, encompassing the sewer leading to it and with a sub-area that leads east to map J. The bit above K6 gets numbered next. I don't think the cluster of half-collapsed hallways at the top of the map needs separate numbers for each 10ft, so they're collectively labelled K10. I think that works out fine here, but there are going to be sections in map M where what to do with the little hallway clusters will be more of a question. 

Everything else works out in the same way going down from here. 

Alright, and then I just repeat this process for all the maps that connect to K!

    alt="The northernmost five maps of Jakalla, all keyed."
    caption="The northernmost five maps of Jakalla, all keyed."

Of these, map M is definitely the one I'm least confident in. The crumbling hallway portion in the center (15-21) is big enough that I don't think it can be one key on the map. I ended up splitting it by vertical line, giving different "lines" of hallways different numbers. I'm not 100% satisfied with it, but I think it'll do. 

There are also three completely disconnected rooms in this section: 4b, 14 and 17. I've given them numbers because they're on the map, but I'll have to work out how the players can actually interact with these rooms. 

Okay. In the spirit of doing useful prep, I'm going to leave the numbering at these five maps, and begin to properly key and stock map K next!
