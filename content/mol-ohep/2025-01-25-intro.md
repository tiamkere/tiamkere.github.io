Sandboxing is fun! It means that I can prep scenarios to my heart's content and let my players loose in them, without worrying about things like "narrative structure" or "plot" or "game balance". Since I love nothing more than making up webs of intrigue, and nothing less than figuring out how many HD of skeletons is a reasonable amount, sandbox campaigns are a platonic ideal. 

So the new year's new campaign is a sandbox campaign set in `Mol Ohep`, a big capitol on the Mollian coast. Mol Ohep is your standard intriguing capitol: densely populated, ages old,  built on former ruins of itself. Sea to the west, plains to the north, mountains to the east; PC's in the middle of it all trying to take advantage of the upcoming mayoral election.

We play WWN, so I told my players to read up on the faction rules and to make up a faction for their characters to all be a part of. They came back a week later with characters who were all part of the noble house that built the city's sewer system, and that their goal was nothing less than the full restoration of said sewer system. 

Cool! Good, concrete goal that ties into the setting and has multiple pathways of interacting with the running clock of the impeding election! 

Sewers, though?

So on the hunt for sewer-related material I went. It did not take me long to stumble on [Dyson's My Private Jakalla](https://dysonlogos.blog/maps/my-private-jakalla/), an incredible under-city map including sewers. The only problem? It is unkeyed, and drawn for the titular city, Jakalla, in the Empire of the Petal Throne setting. The setting is [apparently brilliant](https://www.rpg.net/reviews/archive/18/18663.phtml), it's author [not so much](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M._A._R._Barker#Neo-Nazi/white_supremacist_work). Regardless of either of these factors, my city is Mol Ohep, which *definitely wasn't* drawn by copying a map of late 16th century Amsterdam. It wouldn't be translatable to Jakalla even if I wanted it to be.

The map, therefore, needs two things to be used:
- Adaptation to the setting
- Keying
- Oh also stocking, which I just realised isn't technically a part of keying

The first needs to happen before the second, I think. It seems difficult to reasonably figure out who and what goes where without establishing what "where" means in the context of Mol Ohep. But I've never stocked a map this big before. So I think what I'm specifically going to do is: 

- Adaptation to the setting
	- Figure out how the Jakalla map (J) fits into my Mol Ohep map (MO)
	- Note down the location of MO landmarks on the J, to see what landmarks should have basements/ruins below them
	- Note down the locations of J exits on the MO map, to see where in the city the PCs can get to J
- Keying
	- Figure out whether to use the piecewise maps or the composed map. We play using FoundryVTT, so piecewise would be possible but also a pain to add walls/lights/etc to. 
	- Key the map, probably using the piecewise map names ("1A", "1N", etc) as a basis
- Stocking
	- Uhhh faction influence is probably a good place to start - figure out what areas are controlled by established factors
	- Consider tertiary dungeons - I'm using the lovely [Under the City](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/407420/under-the-city) as a starting point to ease the group in. It's got sewers in it, so these should connect somewhere
	- Random Tables Go!
	- Oh yeah, most importantly: this thing is massive and my players might only explore 5% of it. So I should start at the places they're likely to see (the connection to UTC, as they might chase after a gang of ruffians who broke into a warehouse). 

Yeah, so that's the goal of this blog: to track my progress in this whole endeavour, in the hope that it will teach me something about dungeons and perhaps be helpful to anyone else wanting to use the map.
