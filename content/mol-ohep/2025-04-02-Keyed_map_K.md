## K1. Northern Sewer Passage {#K1}

> Rushing waist-high wastewater flows south towards an intersection. The brick walls are green with algae and the air is warm with stink. 

**Rushing water:** The noise of the water flow and echo of the PC's movement drowns out most other noises.  

**Sewage:** The wastewater is non-potable. Because it is sewage. 
- *Physical Save:* A creature that drinks the water or enters it with open wounds must succeed on a Physical save or contract Brown Rot (ELEPHANT: link!)

**Exits:** 
- S to [K2]({{< ref "#K2" >}}), ledge along west wall. 
- N off the map, may land the PCs on the first floor of [Under the City](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/407420/under-the-city). 
- 1a to the cellar of *Ms. Bea*'s, brothel. Cellar is a changing/bathing/costume room. 1b blocked. 
## K2. Small Sewer Intersection {#K2}

> Streams from the north and east intersect in a whirl of water and noise. The flagstones of the ledge are slippery, and the iron rings attached to the northern wall are cold with damp. 

**Also on the ledge:** Coil of rope, unlit lantern (no oil), one very dirty boot (other on the bottom of the sewer). 

**Rings and ropes**: The iron rings set in the wall are occasionally used by the `Silt Boys` and the `Assassins` to dock small canoes here. 

**Western door**:  Damp wood, creaky, not locked. 
- *OI*: small symbol of the `Assassins` etched into the handle. 

**Exits** :
- N to [K1]({{< ref "#K1" >}})
- E to [K3]({{< ref "#K3" >}}), wooden door. 
- S to [K31]({{< ref "#K31" >}}), downstream. No ledges. 
- W to [K6]({{< ref "#K6" >}}), upstream. Glinting of a grate ahead in any light. 
## K3. Decoy Storage Room {#K3}

> A damp, low-ceilinged cellar. The floor is covered in mouldy straw and rat shit. Nibbled boxes are stacked against the northern wall; the crumbling brickwork of the southern wall is on display.

**Boxes**: wooden. Contain a few ropes, sheets of canvas, nails, etc. 4 in 6 chance of disturbing a **nest of rats** (foul but harmless) whenever opening one. The rats go fleeing out any open door. 

**Southern wall:** 
- *OI*: Some of the bricks aren't mortared together. The missing mortar outlines a door. Pressing on this area of the wall opens a trapped secret door to {{< ref "#K4" >}}.

**Secret door:** Section of brickwork swings away in the southern wall. Not locked, but trapped. 
- Trap: 5 in 6 chance of being active. 
- Active: 
- Inactive: An `Assassin` passed through recently, and deactivated it from the other side. They'll be back in 4 turns. 

**Exits**:
- W to [K2]({{< ref "#K2" >}}), wooden door. 
- S to [K4]({{< ref "#K4" >}}), secret door. 
## K4. Hallway {#K4}

> A dry, pale, low-ceilinged hallway. At its eastern end, a faded mosaic of a figure in robes graces an alcove. Their face has been scratched off. 

**Stone**: pale flagstones, unlike the sewer's brickwork. 

**Mosaic**: Floor-to-ceiling in the alcove, made with tiny painted ceramic tiles. The colours are faded, but some detail is still recognisable. The figure is holding a book in one hand, and an orb in the other. 
- If removed from the wall without harm (very difficult), worth 200sp to the right collector.  
- *Pray or Know 8*: The robes of the figure in the mosaic are like those worn at the **Abbey at Starraxven**, a school for mages about a week's ride north of Mol Ohep. 
- *Know 14*: The mosaic shows **Nokla Deirdram** an obscure headmaster of the Abbey who lived about 1000 years ago. 
- *GM info*: Nokla Deirdram was one of the lead arcanists in the casting of the spell that transmuted a battlefield full of mud into the first goblins. All mages involved died in the casting, so the workings of the spell that did this are unclear to modern mages. Deirdram's surviving notebook is held, in utmost secrecy, at the Abbey. 

**Exits**:
- W to MAP M
- S to [K5]({{< ref "#K5" >}}). Wooden door, unlocked. 

## K5. Former Vesper {#K5}

> A lonely room with a creaking bench set against the eastern wall. 

**Exits**: 
- N to [K4]({{< ref "#K4" >}}). Wooden door, unlocked. 

## K6. The Vaulted Chamber {#K6}

> The sewer carves a channel through the centre of a many-vaulted chamber, passing under a remaining bit of floor as if under a bridge. Over the sewer canal, the vaults drip down into points where pillars were removed to make way for the water. Occasionally, the darkness is broken by wretched spluttering. 

**2d4 Wringwingers**: Hiding in the ceiling. Terrible little creatures: slime-skinned and bulb-eyed, with an almost piscine face, wings, and fingers that are far too long. 
- *Reaction check*: If positive, the imps call out in Common for alms. If negative, hide in the ceiling until they can ambush a single PC for dinner. 
- Want: rid of the ghouls in [K10]({{< ref "#K10" >}}). Fresh fish. Dirtier sewer water. To see what is behind the southern door to [K16]({{< ref "#K16" >}}). 
- Loot: Small bones, buttons, a nice fishing hook, piece of amber (10sp) (across all imps). 

**Pillars**: A row of pillars on either side of the sewer supports the ceiling. Knocking down more than half the pillars collapses that side of the room. 

**Bridge**: Bit of floor left in place during construction of the sewer. 
- Very low. Characters need to lie flat in any boat or duck mostly underwater to pass underneath.
